# Scripts for running the GFETM model

We provided a tutorial at **tutorial_minimal.ipynb** to run our model

main.py is the script for training the model

run.sh is the script for model input 

We also provided an interactive tutorial at colab at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1slqJ0ddEIoEZVPQUFVoDnE-VHln7M627?usp=sharing. Due to the limit of computational resources at colab. This tutorial only covers a small example dataset
